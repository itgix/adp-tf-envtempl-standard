alb-controller, and external-dns controller provision AWS resources introducing dependencies, which prevent terraform destroy to complete.
This script will disable ArgoCD applications self-healing, starting with app-of-apps, and then remove all Ingress resources with waiting for finalizers enabled.
Deleting Ingress resources will cause said controllers to remove AWS resources they manage.

Explicit app-of-apps supported:
infra-services
app-auto-deploy

Application resources belonging to argocd namespace supported only.
